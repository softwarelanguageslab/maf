/**
 * This trait provides the implementation of an incremental modular analysis. Upon a change, schedules the directly affected components for analysis
 * and initiates the reanalysis. Apart from that, several optimisations are implemented that can be optionally enabled by means of an
 * `IncrementalConfiguration`.
 * @note
 *   The incremental analysis is not thread-safe and does not always use the local stores of the intra-component analyses! Therefore, a sequential
 *   work-list algorithm is required.
 * @note
 *   No successive changes to the program are supported by the implementation. However, this "issue" can easily be resolved.
