;;; This example adds protection to an actor A 
;;; through the an actor B that provides access control for A.
;;;
;;; Any message that targets actor A should therefore be processed
;;; by B first, which can decline the message, and should then be forwarded 
;;; to actor A. The issue is that actor A might leak a self-reference 
;;; when replying to the message.
;;;
;;; This vulnerability can be mitigated by only allowing sends from 
;;; actor A to be send through actor B, which sanitizes the payload, 
;;; or by checking whether the payload contains a self-reference 
;;; before allowing the send to happen in actor A.
;;;
;;; The latter option is implemented in this file.
