# MAF benchmark suite

This directory contains the MAF benchmark suite. This benchmark suite currently focuses on
the R5RS Scheme language. Benchmarks are also present for an extension of this language with constructs
for concurrency.

This file contains an overview of the structure of the benchmark suite, as well as
information on particular subsets of this benchmark suite.

## ConcurrentScheme
This folder contains benchmark programs for a concurrent Scheme.
Benchmarks are present for different flavours of concurrency:
* actors,
* concurrent threads with locks,
* futures with atomic variables (atoms).

For futures/threads, the folder 'variations' contains several benchmark programs, each of which is written
multiple times using a different number of futures resp. threads. Some of benchmarks for futures
are based on/rewritten from the benchmarks from threads.

### Actors

The following code is in Scheme-with-Actors. No implementation of this language
exists, but it can be easily run on Racket provided the following macros:

```scheme
(define log-thread (thread (lambda ()
                             (let loop ()
                               (printf "~a" (thread-receive))
                               (loop)))))

(define-syntax self
  (syntax-id-rules ()
    [self (current-thread)]))
(define-syntax-rule (send act msg arg1 ...)
  (thread-send act (cons 'msg (list arg1 ...))))
(define-syntax bind-lists
  (syntax-rules ()
    [(bind-lists (x y ...) l body ...)
     (let ((x (car l)))
       (bind-lists (y ...) (rest l) body ...))]
    [(bind-lists () l body ...)
     (begin body ...)]))
(define-syntax-rule (actor name (state ...) (msg (arg ...) body ...) ...)
  (lambda (m state ...)
    (log "actor ~a received ~a~n" name m)
    (case (car m)
      ((msg) (bind-lists (arg ...) (cdr m) body ...))
      ...)))
(define-syntax-rule (become act v1 ...)
  (begin
    (log "becoming ~a with ~a~n" act (list v1 ...))
    (act (thread-receive) v1 ...)))
(define-syntax-rule (log fmt v ...)
  (thread-send log-thread (format fmt v ...)))
(define-syntax-rule (terminate)
  (begin
    (log "terminating ~a~n" (current-thread))
    (kill-thread (current-thread))))
(define-syntax-rule (create act v1 ...)
  (begin
    (log "creating ~a with ~a ~n" act (list v1 ...))
    (thread (lambda () (act (thread-receive) v1 ...)))))
```

### Futures
All files in this directory were taken/modified from https://github.com/acieroid/scala-am/tree/modularthrds/thrds/suite .
Date: Fri 29/03/2019

* Benchmarks easily modifiable to use futures instead of theards:
    * matmul, trapr
    * fact (without fact-thrd-ref)
    * atoms, stm (without definition of atomic functions)

* Benchmarks modified to use futures instead of theards:
    * bchain, count, dekker, fact, mcarlo, mceval, minimax, msort, pc, pp, rng, stm, sudoku

* Benchmarks now using lists instead of vectors:
    * bchain, pp, sudoku

* Benchmarks using references (to be replaced by atoms):
    * qsort, tsp, sieve, ringbuf, pps, pp, phild, pc, mg, nbody, life, fact, dekker, count, atoms, abp

* Benchmarks now using atoms instead of references:
    * actors, bchain, dekker, fact, pc, pp, rng, stm

* Benchmarks using locks (to be implemented on top of atoms):
    * abp, actors, atoms, bchain, count, fact, life, pc, phild, pp, tsp, stm
 
Lock prelude:   
```scheme
(define (new-lock) (atom #f))
(define (acquire lock)
  (let try ()
    (if (compare-and-set! lock #f #t)
        #t
        (try))))
(define (release lock)
  (reset! lock #f))
```

## R5RS

### AD
All files in this and underlying folders are taken from ftp://cw.vub.ac.be/pub/courses/curriculum/AlgoDat1/programmacode/

Added tests to some files. Tests should normally evaluate to #t.
* prioq.scm should return 'Patrick .

### Gabriel
This directory includes the Gabriel benchmarks, retrieved from http://www.larcenists.org/Twobit/benchmarksAbout.html

Some benchmarks are slightly (or not-so-slightly) modified:
  - added definitions of some Scheme primitives (e.g., assq, member)
  - only run the benchmark for a single iteration, or run on smaller input
  - defines might be desugared to letrecs
  - cond desugared to ifs
  
### Gambit
All files in this and underlying folders are taken from http://github.com/gambit/gambit (2016-11-18).
Source directory: \bench\src

Adapted tests in some files. Tests should normally evaluate to #t.
* browse.scm should evaluate to 1101.

Additional remarks
* cat.scm       =>  Some necessary files are not included in the test directory yet, but the test would fail inevitably because of other reasons.
* slatex.scm    =>  Some necessary files are not included in the test directory yet, but the test would fail inevitably because of other reasons.
* tail.scm      =>  Some necessary files are not included in the test directory yet, but the test would fail inevitably because of other reasons.
* wc.scm        =>  Some necessary files are not included in the test directory yet, but the test would fail inevitably because of other reasons.

Some similar benchmarks were already included in MAF's test suite and are not included again.
* ack.scm
* boyer.scm
* conform.scm
* cpstak.scm
* dderiv.scm
* divrec.scm
* fib.scm
* nqueens.scm
* takl.scm
* trav2.scm

Some programs are not included for other reasons (non-standard primitives, ...).
* crash.scm
* dynamic.scm

### Rosetta

### SCP1
All files in this and underlying folders are taken from http://soft.vub.ac.be/SCPI/ .

Added/adapted tests to some files. Tests should normally evaluate to #t.

Also not all exercises have been included in this benchmark suite. TODO Add if necessary.

Some benchmarks with identical names were kept since the file contents were
sufficiently different. Where needed, benchmarks were modified to make them work (e.g., some benchmarks
did not use valid Scheme syntax such as square brackets or had missing parentheses).
