;; Some, but not all, modifications have been indicated in comments. Significant changes have been made to the file icons.scm, as our implementation does not support icons.
;; Dummy variables have been introduced to avoid top-level defines being interleaved with program expressions.
;; Note: it might be the case that some definitions (such as spells) have accidentally been copied twice.

;; Extra code to avoid user input.
